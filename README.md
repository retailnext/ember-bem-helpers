# ember-bem-helpers

<a href="https://github.com/retailnext/ember-bem-helpers/actions"><img alt="Build Status" src="https://github.com/retailnext/ember-bem-helpers/workflows/CI/badge.svg"></a>

This addon provides [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) helpers for Ember.js applications.

This addon produces BEM classes based on [Two Dashes style](https://en.bem.info/methodology/naming-convention/#two-dashes-style).

No mixins, no code in the component js/ts file needed. Works with template-only components.


## Compatibility

- Ember.js v5.8 or above
- Embroider or ember-auto-import v2

## Installation

```
ember install ember-bem-helpers
```


## Usage

This addon provides two helpers out of the box: `block-name` and `bem`.

Usually you are supposed to use `block-name` once per component, on the top level of the component. However, nested usage is also supported.

Use `bem` helper everywhere you need to get a BEM class.

Here is a basic example:

```hbs
{{block-name "my-button"}}

<button
  class={{bem disabled=@isDisabled}}
  disabled={{@isDisabled}}
  type="button"
>
  <span class={{bem "label"}}>{{@label}}</span>
</button>
```


## Defining a block outside of the component

You can pass a variable to the `block-name` helper like this:

```hbs
{{block-name @externalBlockName}}
```

## Why not modifier?

Modifiers are not run in [FastBoot](http://www.ember-fastboot.com/) and you probably want your elements to have proper classes in a server-side rendered HTML.


## How does it work?

This addon provides AST plugin which transforms `block-name` (which is actually not a real helper) to the {{#let}}{{/let}} block with `blockName` variable and injects it as the first argument to every `bem` helper usage.

So, the above basic example is transformed to the following:

```hbs
{{#let "my-button" as |blockName|}}
  <button
    class={{bem blockName disabled=@isDisabled}}
    disabled={{@isDisabled}}
    type="button"
  >
    <span class={{bem blockName "label"}}>{{@label}}</span>
  </button>
{{/let}}
```
